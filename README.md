# Visualizations for optoelectronics laboratories

## Necessary Python libraries

`pandas scipy matplotlib numpy`

## TODO

- [x] You can now calculate the ideality factor for the photodiode in the dark and under illumination as is in the Laboratory manual described.
- [ ] From transient responses, you can extract the lifetime from the exponential part at various illumination.
- [ ] You can put the transient response at identical excitation on the photodiode with different illumination on the same graph and see the differences. Found where are the differences. In lifetime?
- [x] You can calculate the serial resistivity of the photodiode from the transient response. Analyse if it is the same in the dark and under illumination.
- [ ] Conclude what happens when the voltage step is applied on the photodiode from forward to reverse bias conditions.

We can discuss about obtained results and apply some conclusions form this photodiode behavior in our next laboratory APS.
