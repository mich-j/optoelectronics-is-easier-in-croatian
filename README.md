# Visualizations for optoelectronics laboratories

## Necessary Python libraries

`pandas scipy matplotlib numpy`

## TODO

- [x] Ideality factor for the photodiode in the dark and under illumination (forward)
- [ ] Idelaity factor in the dark and under illumination (reverse)
- [ ] Combine I(U) plots for forward and reverse
- [ ] Transient: extract the lifetime from the exponential part at various illumination.
- [ ] Transient: storage time
- [ ] Transient: rise/fall time
- [ ] Transient: serial resistivity in the dark and under illumination, consider linear and exponential part. Analyse if it is the same in the dark and under illumination.
- [ ] You can put the transient response at identical excitation on the photodiode with different illumination on the same graph and see the differences. Found where are the differences. In lifetime?
- [ ] Conclude what happens when the voltage step is applied on the photodiode from forward to reverse bias conditions.

We can discuss about obtained results and apply some conclusions form this photodiode behavior in our next laboratory APS.
